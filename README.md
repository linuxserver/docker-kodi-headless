# linuxserver/kodi-headless

A headless install of kodi in a docker format, most useful for a mysql setup of kodi to allow library updates to be sent without the need for a player system to be permantely on. You can choose between (at the time of writing) 3 main versions of kodi. 14 helix, 15 isengard and 16 jarvis.

## Usage

```
docker create --name=kodi-headless \
-v <path to data>:/config/.kodi \
-e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid> \
-e VERSION=<version> -e TZ=<timezone> \
-p 8080:8080 -p 9090:9090 -p 9777:9777/udp \
linuxserver/kodi-headless
```

**Parameters**

* `-p 8080` - webui port
* `-p 9090` - JSON-RPC TCP port *optional*, e.g. FileBot use it to send commands
* `-p 9777/udp` - esall interface port
* `-v /config/.kodi` - path for kodi configuration files
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` - for timezone information *eg Europe/London, etc*
* `-e VERSION` - Main version of kodi *optional* - see below for explanation

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```    

## Setting up the application
Set the optional VERSION variable to use an earlier release than what is current from kodi (use only the main version number, 14 , 15 or 16 etc, not point releases). Not setting or removing the VERSION variable will cause the container to update only releases within the same main version number you have installed.

Mysql/mariadb settings are entered by editing the file advancedsettings.xml which is found in the userdata folder of your /config/.kodi mapping. Many other settings are within this file also.

The default user/password for the web interface and for apps like couchpotato etc to send updates is xbmc/xbmc.  

If you intend to use this kodi instance to perform library tasks other than merely updating, eg. library cleaning etc, it is important to copy over the sources.xml from the host machine that you performed the initial library scan on to the userdata folder of this instance, otherwise database loss can and most likely will occur.

## Updates

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it kodi-headless /bin/bash`
* Upgrade to the latest version: `docker restart kodi-headless`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f kodi-headless`
